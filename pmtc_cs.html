                    The current website for the Mar Thoma Church of Philadelphia provides very little helpful information for current church members, such as myself, and is not a site many people find themselves returning to. Over the course of 6 months, I took it on myself to redesign the website to a more informative and welcoming site for members of my church.

                    A redesign! I focused on creating a responsive website that would be available on desktop, mobile, and tablet. My goals consisted of these:

                    <p>
                       As I started my design process, I looked at the web and other church websites for inspiration. This allowed me to continuously make changes and edits to my wireframe. With each new change, I came to understand that I did not need to have a design similar to the original. It was then that I started to overcome my fear of whitespace..

                    <p>   
                       When it came to choosing a color palette, I decided to use almost the same red hues as they are based on the Church's logo

                        After finishing up the design and animation for my prototype, I had three participants test out my prototype. First, I had each user interact with the original website and then my own redesign. After each experience, I had them note things about their experience.

                        With the feedback I was given, I was able to make further changes to my design! Ultimately, I went through 4 different wireframe designs before landing on the final one!

                    <p>
                        This experience was my first big task in the field of UX/UI Design; I had many ups and downs. Now that I have gone through all this, I have learned some valuable things.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        While having a personal connection to this project as a member of the church, I should have still focused more on the research first, rather than relying on what I knew. User testing actually led me to come to terms with some problems I overlooked, which made me make some design changes.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Rather than jumping straight into a wireframe, I should try to branch out my research, such as here, where I looked at other church websites for design inspirations.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Overall, with this project, I got a better idea of the UX Workflow as well as got into the tool Figma. I learned to look not only at the design but also at the usability. While this project is not perfect and has its mistakes, it was definitely a great learning experience I worked through.
