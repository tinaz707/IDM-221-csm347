                As someone who dabbles in guitar, I have used a couple of tuning apps, but none seemed to work well with me. Tuning my guitar was an easy task to do, but the problem mainly was how i wasn't able to learn a song without some level of frustration. Even just finding and getting to the point of being taught the song was a hassle.

                    To understand a user's flow, I analyzed an already existing task flow of a guitar tuning app to take note of what not to do.  I discovered the excessive amount of screens just to be able to locate and learn a song. Knowing this, I created my wireframes with the objective of a less complicated user flow.

                            With my research phase completed, I took it upon myself to sketch out around 30 page layout ideas. I looked towards my initial sketch ideas and my finalized wireframes to start thinking about what microinteractions I could implement. I sketched out 5 ideas for my microinteractions.  My goals for these interactions were that they make the users' experience not only more enjoyable but that it keep them hooked.

                    <p>
                        Through this ten-week journey, I was able to learn much, especially about microinteractions. Now I understand the role microinteractions play and just how important they are to a user's experience. Although they seem small and might not even be noticed by users, they play a big role

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Taking a step back to look over this whole experience, if I had the chance to do this over again, I would definitely do more research about other guitar tuning apps. As well as try talking a few moments to test out my growing protpye with actaully users to be able to utalize any feedback into my design.
