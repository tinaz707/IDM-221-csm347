    <p>Team: Solo</p>
    <p>Tool: Figma</p>
    <p>Role: UX/UI Designer</p>
    <p>Duration: September 2024 - March 2025</p>

    
    <h2><b>Problem</b></h2>
    <p>The current website for the Mar Thoma Church of Philadelphia provides very little helpful information for current church members, such as myself, and is not a site many people find themselves returning to. Over the course of 6 months, I took it on myself to redesign the website to a more informative and welcoming site for members of my church.</p>

    <h2><b>Research</b></h2>

    <p>Before I dove right into solving the problems the website had I first had to analyze the current website and understand what exactly was going on. Here’s what I found:</p>

<!--have pixel arrow as bullet points-->
    <ul>
        <li>Nothing on the website stood out for users to remember by leading to its low engagement by current church members</li>
        <li>All the information on the site was outdated</li>
        <li>With lists of the church's organizations, there was barely information about what they did or who they could contact to find more </li>
    </ul>

    <p>With the analysis done for the moment, I decided to figure out my target audience.  After speaking with many church members, I was able to gather a consensus and create a user persona.</p>

<!--userpersona image-->

        height="..."
        loading="lazy"
        src="..."
        width=".."
    />
    
    <p>To start my redesign, I conducted a card sort to be able to understand what users would want to see in the navigation of the website. What did they consider to be important or not, and what aspects did they understand and didn’t?</p>

    <p>My participants include current church members.</p>

        src="..."
        width=".."
    />

    <p><i>The Red Boxes = what I removed from the original website navigation</i></p>

    <p><i>The Green Boxes = what was added based on the testing.</i></p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
<!--use simple arrow as bullet points-->
    <ul>
        <p>Keep the User Flow Simple</p>
        <p>Increase Interactive Features</p>
        <p>Highlight More Events</p>
   </ul>
   
    <h2>Designing</h2>

    <p>
        Through my process, I looked at the Web and other Church websites for inspiration. This allowed me to continuously make changes and edits to my wireframe. With each new change, I came to understand that I didn’t need to have a design similar to the original, and I overcame the fear of whitespace. 
    </p>

        loading="lazy"
        src="..."
        width=".."
    />

    <p>When it came to choosing a color palette, I decided to use almost the same red hues as they are based on the Church's logo. </p>

     <img 
        alt="Color Palette"
        height="..."
        loading="lazy"
        src="..."
        width=".."
    />

    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>
        After finishing up the design and animation for my prototype, I had three participants test out my prototype.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I had each user interact with the original website with the goal of getting information from the Youth Fellowship Page. Then I had them note things about their experience. </p>
    <p>
        Afterwards, I had them do a similar task with my prototype.
    </p>

    <p>
        With the feedback I was given, I was able to make a few changes to my design
    </p>

    <p>Here was the final <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/TRt0mlqG2F1G5MLzqscrkf/IDM-212-Christina-Mathews-Final?page-id=2%3A2465&node-id=2-6653&viewport=-1728%2C-312%2C0.09&t=ji11vMs1F9DY2dqP-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed" target="_blank">prototype</a></p>

    <h2><b>Outcome</b></h2>
    <p>
        Through this experience, as it was my first big task in the field of UX/UI Design, I had many ups and downs. Now that I have gone through all this, I have learned some valuable things.
    </p>
    <p>
        While having a personal connection to this project as a member of the church, I should have still focused more on the research first, rather than what I knew. User testing actually led me to come to terms with some problems I overlooked, which led to design changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than jumping straight into a wireframe, I should try to branch out my research, such as here, where I looked at other church websites for design inspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, with this project, I got a better idea of the UX Workflow as well as get into the tool Figma. I learned to look not only at the design but also at the usability. While this project isn’t perfect, it was definitely a great learning experience I worked through.
