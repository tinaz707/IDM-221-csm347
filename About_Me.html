    <h1>About Me!</h1>

    <img src="" alt="Image of Me from highschool graduation">

    <p>
        If you still arent aware of who I am well I'm Christina! I am currently an undergraduate student studying User Experience and Interaction Design at Drexel University!
    </p>

    <p>
         I consider myself a creative designer who is confident in my UI skills. I am open-minded and tend to understand usersâ€™ needs, and with this, I bring valuable information and skills to the table. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My main focus is around UI and UX designs, creating wireframes of all fidelity and prototypes.
