                    <p>
                        If you still arent aware of who I am well I'm Christina! I am currently an undergraduate student studying User Experience and Interaction Design at Drexel University!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I consider myself a creative designer who is confident in my UI skills. I am open-minded and tend to understand users’ needs, and with this, I bring valuable information and skills to the table. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My main focus is around UI and UX designs, creating wireframes of all fidelity and prototypes.
